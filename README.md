# JAM (Join Arrange Manage)

Welcome to JAM! If you've made it this far you already know we are an event planning app aimed at making it easier to both plan get togethers with friends and split the cost of having them, be it a group trip to vegas or a movie night with pizza.  What you are really interested in is how we have made such an amazing app and you want to see this masterpiece of code, so let's take a look!

## Getting started

First, clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/Luigi-Faldetta/JAM-Join-Arrange-Manage.git`

To install the required packages, navigate to both server and client folders and run
`npm install`

For the server, run `npm run server`

For the clinent, run `npm start`


We are using PostgreSQL for the database, so make sure you are familiar with it.

**Back End:** NodeJS, TypeScript, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, JWT, socket.io, Nodemailer, Heroku.

**Front End:** ReactJS, TypeScript, Redux, socket.io, TailwindCSS, Flowbite, daisyUI, Cloudinary, Moment.js.

**Testing:** Jest, Supertest, Cypress


## Testing
testing is presently consolidated to either front end or backend, however the command is the same. simply run "npm test" from either the server or client folders to run their respective tests.  

on the backend, jest should run normally in the terminal.  

frontend testing is done with cypress.  if you have not used it before there will be some very minor set up that it will guide you through.
